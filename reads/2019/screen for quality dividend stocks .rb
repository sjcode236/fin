Lewis Altfest, president of Altfest Personal Wealth Management, which manages about $1.2 billion for private clients in New York, said “you should not take the companies with the highest yields. Generally those companies are ones that have weak growth and are vulnerable to dividend cuts, as we saw with Kraft Heinz KHC, +1.12% ” Kraft Heinz cut its dividend by more than a third in February. The stock was down 23% for 2019 through May 10, following a 42% drop in 2018.

For investors who insist on holding individual stocks with attractive dividend yields, Altfest offered some ideas for screening them:

“I would say 3% or more yield, and growth of at least 4% to 5% a year in revenue and profit. And one other element: You want quality stocks with lower volatility — in a beta of 1 or below,” he said.

So beginning with the S&P 500, we narrowed the list:

• Beta for the past 12 months of 1 or less, when compared with the price movement of the entire index: 236 companies.

• Dividend yield of at least 3%: 68 companies.

• Sales increases of at least 5% over the past 12 months: 29 companies.

• Sales per share increases of at least 5% over the past 12 months: 19 companies.

• Then we skipped earnings because of the vagaries of financial reporting. Any company’s earnings for a 12-month period can be skewed by one-time events, accounting changes or noncash items.

We then narrowed the list further to the 15 companies that have increased their regular dividends over the past 12 months. Here they are, sorted by dividend yield:
