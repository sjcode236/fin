=======Diagonal=======      
Diagonal is just a word for selling a closer expiry call which is backed by a lower farther expiry call.      

So I bought a WMT jan 130c for 10.5     
Now lets say tomo wmt runs to 134 and i will sell this week expiry WMT 135c for 1$ .. and let it expire worthless (provided wmt closes below 135) . I just pocketed 1$ and effectively reduced my net premium of jan call by 1$.    

If u sell a cc .. u need to back it by 100 shares right. Here I am backing it by a lower strike call.    
 
It is similar to a vertical.. (same expiry dates) .. diagonal(diff expiry dates)

Vertical is a regular call or put spread.
