Mani N
  Options are risky 
Always think of how much will I lose if I am wrong 

Always play limited risk strategies 

When you buy a call or a put your risk is the amount you invested

When you sell a call or a put your risk is unlimited 

Selling puts and collecting premium is very tempting and you can make consistent money 
But you always have to hedge your position

So do not SELL an option without a HEDGE

With the hedge in plan you can sleep 

In the case mentioned above
Halliburton was selling at $23 

He sold in the money put $25 strike and collected premium

He should have bought an equal number of puts with strike price $20 expiring in the same month

So his risk is now predetermined at $500 per contract 

When HAL went to $5  he was losing on the puts he sold but winning on the puts he bought
with risk predetermined to $500 .

If you want to play the selling game try this strategy:

On stocks that are in an uptrend sell far out of the money puts


On stocks that are in downtrend sell far out of the money calls 

So what you are selling is time value  or insurance to somebody

With every passing day the time value is decreasing 
My analogy is the option is like an ice cube that is constantly melting 

But even in this strategy hedge so you can sleep well
My two cents for what it is worth for all in the group
=============
Identify limited risk strategies
Paper trade for one or two months
Write down every trade 
Reevaluate every trade on the weekend 
Figure out how the option behaved 
What happened to delta , gamma  and theta during the life of that option 

This will give you a good understanding 

Learn about credit spreads 
Start of with this strategy with one contract on each side
It is limited risk limited reward 

When you feel comfortable increase the size of your position 

It is a long  learning process
